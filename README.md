# Match Three: A Classic Puzzle Game

Welcome to **Match Three**, a simple yet addictive puzzle game built using C++ and SFML/Graphics. This game marks the beginning of my journey into the world of C++ programming, and every line of code reflects the learning and passion that went into it. 

## The Vision
This project was designed with simplicity in mind. From the start, the goal has always been to keep the core mechanics intact and avoid unnecessary changes or updates. What you see here is the game in its original form, with only small tweaks made to ensure it runs smoothly. The focus has always been on making a solid, fun game â€” nothing more, nothing less.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Before diving into the game, make sure you've got these tools ready:

- **G++ Compiler** â€” the tool that turns your code into an executable.
- **Linux terminal environment** â€” ideally, you'll be using Ubuntu, but WSL will work too (though not recommended).
- **SFML (libsfml-dev)** â€” the graphics library that powers the game's visuals.
- **Makefile** â€” no need to manually enter commands, just run the makefile and you're good to go.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Game

Getting started is easy:

1. **Clone the repository** â€” grab the game code from the repo.
2. **Build the game** â€” use the `Makefile` to compile everything.
3. **Run the game** â€” launch it straight from your terminal and start playing.
